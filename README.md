We recommend using the "Share Money App" for easy and convenient tracking, eliminating the worry of miscalculations and knowing exactly who to send the money to. Additionally, it generates web pages that automatically sync and update, allowing you to share the URL with everyone from the start, enabling everyone to track the expenses at any time!
